# Web Developer Challenge
_This is taken and modified from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io)._

## The Technology
Both functionality and design are important when building this Todo application. This is a front-end only challenge. The state management only needs to occur on the front end and does not need to sync with any backend or database.

You must use JavaScript to complete the challenge; however, the flavor of JavaScript can be any of the following:
- React
- Vue
- Vanilla JS

You may use any pre- or post-processor for CSS that you want, or you may write plain CSS. We use both plain CSS and Sass at Xenith.

Please do not add any additional NPM packages that are outside of the dev dependencies, (e.g., do not use Moment or Lodash, but feel free to implement linting standards or Styled Components, if that is part of your comfortable workflow).

## The Design
[Here is a link to the Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/Ww2XrYqcNUQ4TXjZmzFDr5/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1). If you are unfamiliar with Figma, take a few moments to familiarize yourself with the software. [Figma's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA) has great resources to help you get up to speed on using their product. Gregory Schmidt also has [a great playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7e8VJ_ZN6epq-oiYOufiuPI-fpDC2Mby) dedicated specifically to developers learning to use Figma. **Treat these designs as you would if a UI designer handed them off for your development sprint.**

## The Challenge Specifics
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the application depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Add new todo items to the list.
- Mark todo items as complete.
- Filter by all / active / complete todo items.
- Clear all completed todo items.

Bonus functionality or features (these are not mandatory but will make you stand out):
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list.
- Swipe to delete.
- Show off your animation / transition skills.
- Deploy your project to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify (or whatever other hosting platform you prefer).
- Include tests using Jest (or whatever JavaScript testing framework you prefer).

## Committing and Pushing Your Work
Commit and push your work to a repository on your own GitHub account. Commit and push as often as you normally would, keeping in mind that we will be paying attention to your git hygiene.

1. Create a `README.md` for your project. This should detail (a.) how we can pull down and run your project locally, (b.) what you learned from the project, and (c.) what you would like to improve / how you could enhance the project in the future.
2. Include any documentation as you would in a production-level codebase. For example, you might want to explain things that are not immediately clear or you might include links to similar solutions where you took inspiration for your work.
3. Ensure that your solution works in all modern browsers that you are reasonably able to test.

## Questions
If you have any questions, please reach out to Britta Rodenbeck at brodenbeck@xenith.com. When completed, please email Britta a link to your GitHub repository and a cute animal gif.
